# SAROS_GUAHAUI
App challenge in python with a game. 

video: "https://youtu.be/9NMLCaEcQQY"

The following work has the objective of exposing a possible solution to the challenge
proposed by NASA: twinkle, twinkle, little star. Its purpose is to develop a learning tool 
in order to help people understand stellar variability. The project is justified by identifying people
who have almost no knowledge.

A video game called Saros Guahaüi has been made for this purpose. The user(people), through deductive methods,
will understand the behavior of the variables that allow us to identify the star brightness variation
and develop concepts such as light curve or stellar evolution. Finally, when the user achieves that,
he will have had a development experience that allowed him to identify the reasons for the star brightness variation
and its apparent impact on the human eye.
